<h3>We chose prompt 1.</h3>

Bees?  It's not just a cards against humanity reference any more.  Bee colonies across the world are dying, and nobody is completely sure why!  If I was prone to hyperbole I would say it is a threat to the survival of the entire planet!  If I was prone to realism I would mention the bees are crucial to pollinating crops which are necessary for the stability of biomes, not to mention the fruits, veggies, grains, and other photosynthesizing organisms we as people like to eat.

So, problem established.  But on twitter, #beedeath has shown up twice since Halloween.  People don't know, because if they knew, they would have to care. Hence, we should make people care.  Thus BeeRescue!  Through making data more accessible, and collecting some of our own, we bring the abstract concept of 'bee death' into the center of the human consciousness. We want to bring bee death information into the public realm. Or... at least we made you think about it.
